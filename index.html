      <p>Unlike most birds, hummingbirds can hover in place, fly straight up, down, sideways, and even backwards. This is possible thanks to their unique ball-and-socket shoulder joints, which allow wings to rotate in a full circle.</p>

      <h2>The Only Birds That Can Fly Backwards</h2>
      <p>Unlike most birds, hummingbirds can hover in place, fly straight up, down, sideways, and even backwards. This is possible thanks to their unique ball-and-socket shoulder joints, which allow wings to rotate in a full circle.</p>

      <h2>Hearts Racing at 1,200 Beats per Minute</h2>
      <p>TTo keep up with their rapid wingbeats — up to 80 per second — hummingbirds have one of the highest metabolisms of any animal. Their hearts can beat more than 1,200 times per minute during flight, requiring them to feed almost constantly.</p>

      <h2>Nature’s Tiny Pollinators</h2>
      <p>Hummingbirds feed mainly on flower nectar, using their long, specialized tongues. While feeding, they transfer pollen from flower to flower, playing a crucial role in ecosystems as pollinators, much like bees and butterflies.</p>

      <h2>Crossing Oceans on Tiny Wings</h2>
      <p>Despite their size, some species of hummingbirds migrate thousands of kilometers. The ruby-throated hummingbird, for example, can fly non-stop across the Gulf of Mexico, a journey of over 800 kilometers in a single flight.</p>

      <h2>Fragile but Resilient</h2>
      <p>Hummingbirds symbolize energy, adaptability, and resilience. Protecting their habitats means protecting not only a bird, but also the ecosystems that depend on their role as pollinators.</p>
